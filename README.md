# rock-paper-scissors

A console-based Rock Paper Scissors game built with JavaScript as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## About the Project

The player competes against the computer for five rounds. The game keeps track of the scores and declares a winner at the end. 

## 🛠Skills Demonstrated

Through building this project, I familiarized myself with JavaScript's syntax and practiced using console.log to test my code. 

## Running the Game

```javascript
// Call the main function in your browsers's console
playGame();
```
